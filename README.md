# AI Models  

This repository contains implementations various AI models:  

## 1. Neural Network from Scratch  
- Built a fully connected feedforward neural network using only NumPy.  
- Trained and tested on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits).  
- Implemented forward and backward propagation without deep learning libraries.  

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Developed a CNN using PyTorch for image classification.  
- Trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
